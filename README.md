RemoteControlledPiCar

Control a Remote controlled car equipted with a raspberry pi using an xbox or similar control on your pc over 3G/4G.

The aim is so that the car can be controlled (Almost) Anywhere in the world.


What i've done so far:
 - Modded the car to accomodate the raspberry pi.
 - Added the ESC and replaced the steering servo.
 - Fitted a new servo and wired up the Motor to the ESC.
 - Bought a Daughterboard that can control servos (and ESC), bought from http://electronics.chroma.se/rpisbv3.php.
 - Wired up the ESC to the motor, Connected the steering servo and ESC to the daughter board.
 - Connected and mounted the raspberry pi camera.
Basically, all of the hardware works well and is fine :)

What i need to do:
 - Coding :)
 - Get the raspberry pi to setup a webpage that lets me view live camera images, and lets me control the servos/esc.
 - Get an xbox to usb lead & get the software to make it work with my computer so i can control through the webpage.
Basically, all of the software needs to be done :(


Projects that have been done before and i think will help:

 - Shaun Butler: He made an awesome Raspberry pi controlled car that you control through the gyroscopes in your smartphone. As he uses the same esc and daughter board, most of the code will be very useful for insparation! Although i would need to edit the way that the commands are sent through the webpage. https://github.com/shaunuk/picar/ Is his original repo, which to start off with I've cloned, but i will edit quite a bit. 

 - When I went up to Manchester's Maker faire (All the way from London!), I met Will Jessop and his awesome ping-pong robot. Although it is rather different, and has a different purpose, he had managed to interface an xbox controller with the pi to control it! I found his gamepad code https://github.com/wjessop/gamepad, and im going to try to use that to help control the Pi. Only thing is, it is mac only :(. I decided: http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/xboxdrv/ would be good after a bit of googling, but even so, Will's ping-pong machine has some quite good code, so going to be using some of it for inspiration aswell :D


So, I hope it goes well... and soon it should be working! Feel free to contribute and/or make your own Car. I'm going to be posting an Instructable (on Instructables) if it works, meanwhile any help would be great :D. My profile is http://www.instructables.com/member/madminor - Favourite and follow.
